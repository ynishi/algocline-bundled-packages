--- alc_shapes.instrument — Malli-style declarative shape instrumentation.
---
--- Wraps a module entry (e.g. `M.run`) with dev-mode shape assertions
--- driven by `M.spec.entries[entry_name].{input, result}`, replacing the
--- manual pattern:
---
--- ```lua
--- function M.run(ctx) ... ; S.assert_dev(ctx.result, "voted", "sc.run"); return ctx end
--- ```
---
--- with:
---
--- ```lua
--- function M.run(ctx) ... ; return ctx end
--- M.run = S.instrument(M, "run")  -- at module tail
--- ```
---
--- ## Why a wrapper layer exists
---
--- The goal is **caller transparency**: recipe and downstream callers
--- should not need to know that shape checking exists. Three analogues
--- converge on this shape:
---
--- - **Malli `mi/instrument!`** (Clojure) — rewrites a `var` to a dev-
---   gated wrapper derived from a function schema. Production code keeps
---   calling `(my.ns/do-thing x)` unchanged; instrumentation is applied
---   at the var level so every caller gets validation for free. Source:
---   `https://github.com/metosin/malli/blob/master/docs/function-schemas.md`.
--- - **Zod v4 `z.function({ input, output }).implement(fn)`** — factory
---   returns a wrapped function. `fn` becomes the body; the wrapper
---   parses input and output on each call. Source:
---   `https://zod.dev/api#function` (v4 function API, 2025).
--- - **tRPC procedure builder** — input/output validators are declared
---   at the route; the builder wraps the handler so it only ever sees
---   validated data. Source: `https://trpc.io/docs/server/validators`.
---
--- All three enforce the boundary **once**, at the edge of the module,
--- by returning a replacement function. Caller-side wrapping (each
--- consumer inserts its own assert) is explicitly rejected as a Hyrum-
--- law hazard.
---
--- ## Relationship to spec_resolver.run
---
--- `spec_resolver.run(pkg, ctx)` is the **caller-wrap** form: consumers
--- that do not trust the pkg to self-validate route the call through
--- `SR.run` for a resolver-side pre/post check. `instrument` is the
--- **producer-wrap** form: the pkg self-decorates its entry once, and
--- every caller (`pkg.run(ctx)` direct, `SR.run(pkg, ctx)` via resolver,
--- or anything else) inherits the check for free. Both forms coexist;
--- bundled pkgs prefer `instrument` because it makes the producer the
--- single source of truth for its own contract.
---
--- ## Alc-specific adaptation
---
--- Two entry paradigms coexist. The declaration shape decides which
--- wrapper path runs.
---
--- ### (1) ctx-threading (default; `spec.entries.{e}.input`)
---
--- Every entry takes a single `ctx` table, writes `ctx.result = {...}`,
--- returns `ctx`. Applies to 90%+ of bundled pkgs.
---
--- - **Input** assertion targets the first positional argument (`ctx`).
---   Reads `M.spec.entries[entry_name].input` (string registry key or
---   inline schema; string is coerced to `T.ref` by `spec_resolver.resolve`).
--- - **Result** assertion targets `ret.result` (ctx-threading), falling
---   back to `ret` itself when the function does not return a table with
---   `.result` set. Reads `M.spec.entries[entry_name].result`.
---
--- ### (2) direct-args (library-style; `spec.entries.{e}.args`)
---
--- Pure library-style pkgs (e.g. `bft.threshold(n, f) -> number`,
--- `kemeny.aggregate(rankings) -> ranking`) take positional args and
--- return a raw value. `args` is an **array of shapes** aligned to the
--- function's positional parameters; the wrapper checks each `args[i]`
--- against the caller-supplied i-th argument.
---
--- - **Input** assertion: for each `args[i]` (non-nil slot), asserts the
---   caller's i-th argument. Slots may be `nil` to skip validation at
---   that position (useful for opaque options tables).
--- - **Result** assertion targets the **raw return value** (not
---   `ret.result`) — library functions return scalars / tables directly.
--- - **Optional args** use `T.x:is_optional()` at the corresponding slot;
---   the check handler accepts nil for optional schemas at top level.
---
--- `input` and `args` are mutually exclusive per entry. `spec_resolver`
--- raises at declaration time when both are set, so the wrapper body
--- only needs to branch on one side.
---
--- ### Shared
---
--- - **Hint** is `"<meta.name>.<entry_name>"`, e.g. `"calibrate.assess"`
---   or `"bft.threshold"`. Arg-position hints append `":arg<i>"`.
--- - **Gating** is `ALC_SHAPE_CHECK=1` (existing dev-mode env var). When
---   off, the wrapper only pays one `os.getenv` per call.
---
--- ## Override form (rare)
---
--- Most packages declare every entry under `M.spec.entries.*` so no
--- override is needed. The optional `spec` argument exists as an escape
--- hatch for callers that want to instrument an entry not declared in
--- `M.spec` (e.g. temporary test scaffolding):
---
--- ```lua
--- -- ctx-threading override:
--- M.custom = S.instrument(M, "custom", {
---     input  = T.shape({ task = T.string }, { open = true }),
---     result = "voted",
--- })
---
--- -- direct-args override:
--- M.threshold = S.instrument(M, "threshold", {
---     args   = { T.number, T.number },
---     result = T.number,
--- })
--- ```
---
--- `spec` takes precedence over `M.spec.entries[entry_name].*` when both
--- are given. This matches Zod's `.implement({ input, output })` which
--- lets the caller override the schemas declared on the factory.
--- Specifying `input` and `args` together (either via the spec override
--- or via `M.spec.entries.{e}.*`) is rejected at load time.
