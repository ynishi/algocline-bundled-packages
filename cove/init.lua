--- CoVe — Chain-of-Verification: draft-verify-revise cycle
--- Reduces hallucination by: draft → generate verification questions →
--- answer them independently → produce verified final response.

--- Based on: Dhuliawala et al., "Chain-of-Verification Reduces

--- ctx.task (required): The question/task to answer
--- ctx.n_questions: Number of verification questions (default: 3)
