--- SC — Self-Consistency: independent sampling with majority vote
--- Samples multiple reasoning paths for the same problem,
--- then selects the most consistent answer by majority voting.
---
--- Based on: Wang et al., "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought
--- Reasoning in Language Models" (2022, arXiv:2203.11171)
---
--- Usage:
---   local sc = require("sc")
---   return sc.run(ctx)
---
--- ctx.task (required): The problem to solve
--- ctx.n: Number of reasoning paths to sample (default: 5)
--- ctx.temperature_hint: Hint text for diversity (default: varies per sample)
